**Inspection of Electrical Power Distribution Grid**

We present photographs of inspections of the electrical power network (13.8 kV) carried out in southern Brazil.
The inspections were performed close to the city of Blumenau by researchers from the high voltage laboratory, Regional University of Blumenau (FURB). 

240 photographs of the electrical power network are presented:  
120 are of damaged structures and/or components.  
120 are in normal conditions.    
 
Among the problems found in the distribution network, the following stand out:
* Contaminated insulators.
* Broken insulators.
* Contaminated crosshead.
* Birds' nests on the crosshead.
* Fungi strongly attached to the structure.
