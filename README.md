**Contaminated Insulators**

We present photographs of contaminated insulators, pin-type 13.8 kV.

It was performed in 40 different conditions of contamination, based on the combination of ESDD and NSDD.   
*Equivalent salt deposit density (ESDD)*  
*Non-soluble deposit density (NSDD)*

For each condition, 4 different sides photographs, and using 4 different zooms were performed.  
In total, 640 photographs of contaminated insulators are presented.  
For comparison purposes, 48 photographs of clean insulators are also presented.

The analysis was performed by researchers from the high voltage laboratory, Regional University of Blumenau (FURB).
