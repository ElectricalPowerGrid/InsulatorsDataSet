**Contaminated Insulators**

We present photographs of contaminated insulators, pin-type 13.8 kV.

It was performed in 8 different conditions of contamination, based on the combination of ESDD and NSDD.
*Equivalent salt deposit density (ESDD)*
*Non-soluble deposit density (NSDD)*

For each condition, 4 different sides photographs, and using 4 different zooms are presented.
640 photographs of contaminated insulators are presented.

The analysis was performed by researchers from the high voltage laboratory, Regional University of Blumenau (FURB).
